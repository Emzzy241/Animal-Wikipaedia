                                crawl on

                                a lot of People fear them and hate them and then they result to Killing them but with
                                new laws being
                                passed on <b>Wildlife</b> and with guys like "Snakes in the City" a guy that catches
                                snakes for a
                                Living, takes them away from the Populace and gets paid a lot to do it we believe People
                                might stop
                                the narrative of killing Snakes. So a little bit of information: when you see Snakes be
                                calm and
                                think on how to catch that Snake and remove from your Habitat

                                Turtles are great guys and the reason for them being a great guy is that they're both
                                Terrestial(Animals living on Land) and Aquatic(Animals living in water). They are really
                                really slow
                                when it comes to movement and one more amazing thing about them is how they age so old
                                before they
                                die. Studies have shown that a Turtle can live more than a <b>Thousand</b> years which
                                if you ask me
                                I think its really great. The last one I heard was about <b>Three Thousand</b> years of
                                age and they
                                said the Turtle was close to a King which I think is also great, one more thing I find
                                fascinating
                                about Turtles is their ability to cover up themselves with their shells where they're
                                endangered.
                                They're really a nice specie of Animal though

                            <h6> <br> Insects are the little guys that could really cause havoc to your Skins as a
                                Human.
                                They're more
                                than twenty species of insects and like we said earlier on they're not so Friendly when
                                it comes to
                                the Human Skin and when it comes to blood searching. They're nicknamed here in
                                <b>Africa</b> to be
                                blood searching set of individuals. They're very ubiquitous over here and many wonder if
                                they're in
                                places like the UK or the USA which I laugh a lot when I hear such comments. If you're
                                wondering
                                about what I just said, Yes they are in the United Kingdom, in the United States,name it
                                but one
                                thing to put in mind is that all animals have some certain weather Conditions their body
                                suits in.
                                So in essence they might not be in the UK or USA due to weather conditions
